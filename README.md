### Hello, Developer!

You now know how to use CRUD with Express and Sequelize so it's time to do it yourself.

A kid has come to you with an idea for an API to keep track of his candies. You love candies! So, you accept his proposal. You are given a resource Candy  (in the `/db/candies.js` directory) and use the kid's candy "data" to display it on the webpage.
Build your own application from scratch.


Your app should have the following routes:

* `/` - Root route, would welcome user and introduce the app
* `/candies` - a **get** route would render a `json` containing information about ALL candies
* `/candies` - a **post** route that would add a new candy to the database
* `/candies/:id` - a **get** route that would render a information about the candy with requested id.
* 


Bonus:
* add some pictures of candies and display it on the page when a certain endpoint is hit.
